EtsyApp is a simple app which uses the Etsy API to do the following two activities.

1) Retrieve 100 ShopIds from the Etsy API each of which has at least one active listing.

2) For each of these IDs, retrieve tag names, associated with them

3) Write to a file records in the format {shopName, Tagname, Count}

4) print the records on the terminal where each record is of the format {shopName: tag1, tag2 .. tag5} [top 5 tags based on the count]
